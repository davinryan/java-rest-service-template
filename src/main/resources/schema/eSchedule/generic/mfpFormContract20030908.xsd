    Version:        		1.0
    Version Created:	9 August 2002
    
    Schema Name:	eFormContract20030722				 
    Version:        		1.2
    Version Created:	22 July 2003

    Schema Name:	mfpFormContract20030901			 
    Version:        		1.3
    Version Created:	01 September 2003
    Change:			Renamed as a difference now exists between eSchedule and mfpSchedule
    					The problems of 22 July with namespace were resolved but did not solve all problems very cleanly. 
    					To this end, a review of namespace usage was investigated and a solution developed.
    					The solution changes the way in which namespaces are addressed internally and externally and makes it much tidier.
    					The structure of the library has also changed to bring all directories in at the same structure level to accommodate type libraries.
    					The contract_acc_identifier in now part of datatypes. A data type will need to reference the data type namespace
    					ie. xmlns:xmldt="http://xmlschema.acc.co.nz/"

    Schema Name:	mfpFormContract20030908			 
    Version:        		1.4
    Version Created:	08 September 2003
    Change:			The mfpFormContract was created on 20030901 as patterns were required on contract_acc_identifier. 
   				 	The datatype namespace was changed from xmlns:xmldt to xmlns:accdt as XML Spy objects to using xml as part of the name so it was 						changed to acc. It treats xml as a reserved word.
