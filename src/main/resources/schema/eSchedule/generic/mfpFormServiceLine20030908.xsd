    Schema Name:	eFormServiceLine20030901				 
    Version:        		1.3
    Version Created:	01 September 2003
    Change:			Renamed as a difference now exists between eSchedule and mfpSchedule.
    					The problems of 22 July with namespace were resolved but did not solve all problems very cleanly. 
    					To this end, a review of namespace usage was investigated and a solution developed.
    					The solution changes the way in which namespaces are addressed internally and externally and makes it much tidier.
    					The structure of the library has also changed to bring all directories in at the same structure level to accommodate type libraries.
					The service_item_code in now part of datatypes. A data type will need to reference the data type namespace
					ie. xmlns:xmldt="http://xmlschema.acc.co.nz/"

    Schema Name:	eFormServiceLine20030908				 
    Version:        		1.4
    Version Created:	08 September 2003
    Change:			The mfpFormServiceLine was created on 20030901 as patterns were required on service_item_code. The datatype namespace was 						changed from xmlns:xmldt to xmlns:accdt as XML Spy objects to using xml as part of the name so it was changed to acc. It treats xml as a 					reserved word.
